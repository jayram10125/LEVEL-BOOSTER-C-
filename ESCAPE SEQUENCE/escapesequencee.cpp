#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout<<"hello \nworld"<<endl; //    \n ---->for new line Also endl is used to next line but difference is that \n should be in double iinverted commas but there is no need of inverted commas for endl
    cout<<"hello \tworld"<<endl;//     \t ---->fot a tab space i.e 7 space
    cout<<"\"HELLOW\""<<endl; //  \" to get the output in inverted commas
    cout<<"\'welcome\'"<<endl;//  \' to get the output in single inverted commas
    cout<<"    jay"<<endl; 
    cout<<" \rjay"<<endl; //to remove the previous space 
    cout<<"\a"<<endl; // to create an alarm beep but depends on system
    return 0;
